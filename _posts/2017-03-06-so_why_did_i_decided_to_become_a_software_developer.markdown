This is a very interesting question; I have always been attracted to understand how things work behind a device. Nowadays we live in an always-connected world and I decided that I could be part of the movement that makes things work better online. There is always a better version to do something and for me, software development is the best fit to start a career where I can have a direct impact into what the everyday life consumer use and need. In addition, New York City has a huge demand for developers in the upcoming years and I see there is very little Latinos in this field so I intend to be a voice in the Big Apple.
